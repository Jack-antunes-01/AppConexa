This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

Check the Figma Prototype:

## Step 0: Setup Environment

https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Install and configure Android Studio.

## Step 1: Install packages

Firstly, you need to install packages and generate node_modules folder.

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn
```
## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Now, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

## Congratulations! :tada:
